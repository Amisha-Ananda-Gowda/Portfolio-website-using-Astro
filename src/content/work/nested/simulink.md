<p>In Simulink, I learned the foundational skills for creating and refining models through a user-friendly interface. I became proficient in utilizing block diagrams as visual representations of intricate real-world systems. Through simulation, I can now observe the behavior of various components and algorithms, allowing for system optimization and improved understanding.</p>
